<title>Frequently Asked Question (FAQ)</title>
    <h1 class="title">Frequently Asked Question (FAQ)</h1>

	<h4>Q. How safe is shopping on Cramiture.co.uk?</h4>
	<p>It is vitally important to Cramiture  that you can give us your personal and payment details 
	over the internet in complete confidence. That’s why we have invested in the most advanced 
	site security available. It provides all the protection and assurance you need to make any 
	transactions or give personal information privately and securely.</p>
	
	<h4>Q. How do I place an order? </h4>
	<p>Once you have selected your Cramiture, add the items to your shopping basket. Each item is 
	individually priced. You will be invited to choose our Premier Delivery Service, or you may 
	opt to collect your order from your local store or distribution centre (aka collection point 
	or warehouse). Then simply follow the prompts on screen for your billing and delivery details
	, finally select your payment method and, when you are ready, submit your order.</p>
	<p>If you have any special instructions or important information, about access to your property
	for example, please tell us in the 'Delivery Instructions’ box.</p>
	<p>	If you miss any details, an error page will ask you to check and complete them before you
	move on. Once you complete your order, a screen will appear confirming the information you have 
	given us. At this stage you will have the chance to make any changes to your selected Cramiture, 
	delivery address and payment details. When you’re sure the order is correct, click the ‘submit’ 
	button. You’ll automatically receive a ‘Thank you’ page. Please print it out for your records.</p>
	<p>An automatic acknowledgement email (starting with 20….) will be sent to you with brief details
	of what happens next. Within 2 working days you should receive a second email confirming your 
	Cramiture  order number (starting 80…) and delivery details, including any contact numbers you may need.</p>
	
	<h4>Q. Will I receive an order confirmation?</h4>
	<p>Your official Cramiture  order confirmation will be sent to you in the post as part of a 
	customer welcome pack. It will also include your 5 year structural guarantee and, if appropriate,
	your guardsman leaflet.</p>
	
	<h4>Q. Can I make changes to my order?</h4>
	<p>If you want to make any changes to your order, e-mail us or telephone us for free on 0800 804 8879
	for further assistance. We will do our best to help. Early alterations within a few days aren’t usually 
	a problem. However, once the goods are in production with the manufacturer we are bound to accept them,
	so we may have to charge you a cancellation fee to cover our costs. Please note that when merchandise
	is ordered at different times we cannot guarantee colour matching due to variations between batches.
	Changing an order may cause a delay with your delivery time and may alter the price you have been quoted.</p>
	
	<h4>Q. How do I measure properly? </h4>
	<p>It is important to check that your Cramiture will go into your room before placing your order. 
	To avoid disappointment, please refer to our Online Measuring Guide for assistance.</p>
	
	<h4>Q. Can you tell me the availability of a specific item?</h4>
	<p>Before you select a product to buy online an indication of the current lead time for delivery
	will have been given on the product page. Please be aware that this information changes daily.
	Cramiture  cannot be held responsible for delays beyond our control. We will inform you as soon
	as we become aware of any changes in the time original given when you placed your order. For more
	information, contact us by e-mail or call free on 0800 804 8879 for further assistance. Alternatively 
	you can call your nearest Cramiture  store on free phone 0800 7830 830.</p>
	
	<h4>Q. Where is my order? </h4>
	<p>If you wish to check the delivery of your order, please e-mail us or call us for free on
	0800 804 8879 for further assistance.</p>
	
	<h4>Q. Do you price match? </h4>
	<p>Cramiture  believes in offering the very best value. In the unlikely event that you find the exact 
	same item for sale elsewhere at a lower price (including offers) before your Cramiture is delivered,
	we will gladly match that price and refund the difference.</p>
	
	<h4>Q. What if my order is late? </h4>
	<p>You should have been given an estimated delivery time. If it changes, we will let you know straight
	away. While Cramiture  cannot be held liable for any delays which are beyond our control, we will make 
	every effort to keep you informed. If you have any delivery problems, please e-mail us or call us for 
	free on 0800 804 8879 for further assistance.</p>
